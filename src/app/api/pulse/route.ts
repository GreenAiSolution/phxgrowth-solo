/**
 * First-party analytics. No script, no vendor, no cookie.
 *
 * The site had zero instrumentation: one page, one conversion path, and no way
 * to know whether anybody arrived, how far they read, or which upgrade they
 * reached for. Selling attribution while running blind is not a position worth
 * defending.
 *
 * Deliberately not a third-party tag. A tag would mean a consent banner, a
 * blocked request for a third of visitors, and someone else's cookie on a page
 * whose entire argument is that it is straight with you. This is a beacon to
 * our own origin carrying four fields, none of which identify a person.
 *
 * Storage is intentionally the cheapest thing that works: a structured log
 * line, mirrored to the Zapier hook when one is configured, so it lands in a
 * sheet without a database. If volume ever justifies it, point this at a real
 * store — the client contract will not need to change.
