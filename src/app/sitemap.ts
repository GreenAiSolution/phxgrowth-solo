/**
 * Short, because the site is short.
 *
 * Two public pages and the legal set. `/` is the flight line; `/upgrades`
 * is the price list, and it is the one most likely to earn a search result —
 * "what does X cost" is a query, and a deck of canvases is not an answer to it.
 * The console and admin are noindex by nature and have nothing to gain from
 * being crawled. The legal set is generated from `LEGAL_DOCUMENTS` rather than
 * typed out, so a new document is discoverable the moment it ships rather than
 * whenever somebody remembers to edit a list.
 *
 * `siteUrl`, not `appUrl`: with NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL unset, every <loc> in this
 * file read `http://localhost:3000`, which submits a sitemap of dead URLs.
 *
 * Note it is not `publicUrl` either. That one falls back to phxgrowth.com so
 * email links always land somewhere real — correct for a link, catastrophic
 * here, because a sitemap listing another domain's URLs as ours is a claim
 * Google acts on.
