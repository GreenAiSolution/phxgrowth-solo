/**
 * THE GATE.
 *
 * DIRECTION
 *   The upgrade catalogue makes a promise for every automation build, in
 *   writing, on a public price list:
 *
 *     The Job Runner — "Anything that moves money — a quote going out, an
 *     invoice being raised, a chase being sent — waits at a gate until you
 *     release it, and every release is recorded against your name."
 *
 *     The Comeback — "Nothing reaches a past customer without being visible to
 *     you first. You can read the queue before it sends, pull anybody out of
 *     it, and see afterwards exactly who was contacted, when, and what came
 *     back."
 *
 *   This file is that promise, and it is deliberately the first thing built —
 *   before either loop exists. A gate retrofitted onto a running automation is
 *   a gate with a bypass, because the bypass is how it ran for the weeks
 *   before the gate arrived.
 *
 *   The parent publishes the standard we are working to: every loop
 *   "inspectable node by node for as long as we fly together, never a black
 *   box". An automation sold beside that page has to be openable.
 *
 * THE LOAD-BEARING IDEA
 *   The *kind* of action decides the minimum hold, not the caller.
 *
 *   If an agent could choose its own hold, the promise would be worth nothing
 *   the first time a prompt went strange or a refactor passed the wrong
 *   argument — an invoice would go out on a timer because something asked
 *   nicely. `ACTION_KINDS` is a fixed registry, `resolveHold` can only ever
 *   make a hold stricter, and `propose` reads the registry rather than the
 *   argument. A caller asking for a weaker gate than its action kind allows
 *   gets the stricter one and no error, because failing closed silently is
 *   correct here and failing open loudly is not.
 *
 * BLUEPRINTS
 *   Everything that decides *what happens to an action* is pure and tested —
 *   `resolveHold`, `decide`, `canRelease`, `canWithdraw`, `isTerminal`. Only
 *   the four functions at the bottom touch the database, and none of them make
 *   a decision the pure layer has not already made. This is the same split
 *   `night-shift.ts` uses, for the same reason: the interesting logic should be
 *   testable without a Postgres.
 *
 *   There is no model call anywhere in this file. The gate must behave
 *   identically on a day the Anthropic API is down.
