/**
 * ONE BUSINESS, ONE SET OF NUMBERS.
 *
 * A visitor does not read this site the way its authors do. They read a price
 * on the page, click "Terms" in the footer, and read a fee schedule. They get
 * an email and read the guarantee again. They see the description Google
 * printed. Every one of those surfaces was written at a different time, and
 * nothing made them agree.
 *
 * They did not agree. The legal set described "two lines of service: AI
 * Automation Agents and Ad Operations Management" and quoted six monthly fees
 * between $1,297 and $7,997 — none of which appear anywhere on the site, which
 * sells five upgrades between $1,600 and $4,200. The Terms said subscriptions
 * bill here through Stripe; the page's own FAQ said upgrades land on the
 * existing PHX/GROWTH invoice with no second account. Both were published. A
 * prospect reading carefully enough to check would have found a contract for a
 * different company.
 *
 * Nothing errored, nothing failed a build, and no test caught it, because
 * every surface was internally consistent and tested in isolation. These tests
 * are the ones that read across the seams.
