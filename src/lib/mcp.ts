/**
 * THE MCP SERVER — tools and handlers.
 *
 * DIRECTION
 *   `src/app/api/catalogue/route.ts` has said this since it shipped:
 *
 *     "The second [reader] is the MCP server in `phxgrowth-plus-mcp-server/`,
 *      which lets the agency quote a bundle from Slack without opening the
 *      site."
 *
 *   and the README says the catalogue endpoint "is the single source the MCP
 *   server reads". There was no MCP server. There was no such directory.
 *
 *   This codebase fails its own build over a percentage on a marketing page
 *   that nobody can verify, and over a Terms document quoting a fee the
 *   business does not charge. A README describing a component that does not
 *   exist is the same defect, in the file most likely to be read first by
 *   somebody deciding whether to trust the rest of it. `mcp.test.ts` now
 *   enforces the claim rather than the claim merely being made.
 *
 * WHY IT DOGFOODS THE PRODUCT
 *   This site sells Answer Engine Visibility — the product is being a business
 *   an assistant can describe accurately. A price list an assistant can only
 *   reach by scraping HTML is the exact failure the instruments on the home
 *   page diagnose in other people's businesses. Publishing the offer as
 *   callable tools is the least defensible thing to skip while charging for
 *   it.
 *
 * WHY THE PROTOCOL IS HAND-ROLLED
 *   MCP over HTTP is JSON-RPC 2.0 with three methods that matter — the
 *   handshake, the tool list, and the call. That is a few hundred lines,
 *   fully testable, with no new dependency in a repository whose whole posture
 *   is that it installs and runs with nothing configured. Pulling in an SDK to
 *   avoid writing `if (method === "tools/list")` would be the larger cost.
 *
 * BLUEPRINTS
 *   Everything here is pure: a request object in, a response object out. No
 *   database, no auth, no network. `app/api/mcp/route.ts` is the transport and
 *   holds no logic. That split is what lets the entire protocol be tested
 *   without starting a server.
