/**
 * The legal set — Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and the Master Services
 * Agreement.
 *
 * DIRECTION
 *   The login page said "By continuing you agree to the terms" and there were
 *   no terms. Stripe requires published Terms and a Privacy Policy before it
 *   will approve an account, and nobody should be billed $6,997/mo against a
 *   handshake. These are written against what this platform actually sells —
 *   the real upgrades, the real prices, the real sub-processors — rather than
 *   being a generic template with the business name swapped in.
 *
 * BLUEPRINTS
 *   Documents are structured data, not JSX, so all three render through one
 *   component and the sub-processor list can be derived rather than duplicated.
 *   `legal.test.ts` asserts the prices quoted in the MSA match the catalogue,
 *   because a fee schedule that drifts from the pricing page is the single
 *   worst kind of stale content on a site that takes money.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED, AND WHY IT MATTERED
 *   These documents were written for an earlier version of this business and
 *   were never revisited when the site was rebuilt. They described "two lines
 *   of service: AI Automation Agents and Ad Operations Management", and their
 *   fee table listed six plans from $1,297 to $7,997 a month.
 *
 *   None of that is what this site sells, and none of those prices appear
 *   anywhere a visitor can see. So a prospect who clicked "Terms" in the
 *   footer — from a page offering five upgrades between $1,600 and $4,200 —
 *   was reading a contract for a different company. They also contradicted the
 *   page's own FAQ outright: the FAQ says upgrades land on your existing
 *   PHX/GROWTH invoice with no second account, and section 3 said subscriptions
 *   were billed here through Stripe.
 *
 *   The commercial sections now describe the upgrades business and generate
 *   their fee table from `UPGRADES` and `BUNDLES`, so the contract and the page
 *   cannot say different numbers. Everything non-commercial — privacy,
 *   sub-processors, liability, governing law — is unchanged.
 *
 * IMPORTANT
 *   This is a careful, specific draft — not legal advice. It should be reviewed
 *   by a lawyer licensed in Arizona before it is relied on. Where a real
 *   decision was needed (governing law, notice periods, liability cap) the
 *   choice is stated plainly so a reviewer can see and change it.
